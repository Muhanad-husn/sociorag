# SocioGraph Cleanup and Optimization

## Overview

This document details the cleanup and optimization process performed on the SocioGraph codebase to make it more maintainable and production-ready.

## Changes Made

### Removed E2E Tests
All End-to-End (E2E) test scripts were removed to streamline the codebase and focus on essential functionality:

- Removed `final_e2e_test_fixed.py`
- Removed `run_e2e_test_improved.py`
- Removed `test_final_modified.py`
- Removed `test_phase5.py`
- Removed comprehensive API test files like `test_api.py`, `test_api_clean.py`, and `test_api_fixed.py`
- Removed `test_admin_endpoints.py` and `test_all_llm_models.py`

### Retained Pipeline Tests
Maintained essential pipeline tests that test specific components:

- `test_entity_extraction_module.py`
- `test_enhanced_entity_extraction.py`
- Tests in the `tests/retriever` directory

### Removed Non-Essential Scripts
Cleaned up the root directory and scripts folder by removing non-essential files:

- Removed documentation files that weren't directly related to user workflows
- Removed cleanup, development, and testing scripts that are no longer needed
- Kept essential configuration and startup files

### Updated Documentation
Updated documentation to reflect the current state of the project:

- Updated README.md with current status and startup instructions
- Updated project_overview.md to reflect the production-ready status
- Updated testing documentation to remove E2E test references
- Created this cleanup and optimization summary

## Updated Testing Strategy

The project now follows a more focused testing approach:

1. **Pipeline Tests**: Tests that verify specific components and functionality pipelines
2. **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual functions and classes
3. **Integration Tests**: Tests for interactions between components

This approach provides better maintainability while still ensuring code quality. The focus has shifted from comprehensive E2E tests to more targeted component tests that are easier to maintain and faster to run.

## Current Application Structure

The application now has a cleaner, more maintainable structure:

- **Backend**: The FastAPI backend with core business logic
- **Frontend**: The Preact/Tailwind UI
- **Configuration**: Config files in the root directory
- **Documentation**: Essential user and developer guides

## Starting the Application

The application can be started using the included quick start script:

```powershell
.\quick_start.ps1
```

This will:
- Start the backend server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Start the frontend on http://localhost:5173
- Open the frontend in your default browser
