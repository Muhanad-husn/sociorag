# File Reorganization - May 27, 2025

## Overview

This document records the reorganization of files in the SocioGraph project to improve the project structure and organization.

## Changes Made

1. **Testing Files Relocated**
   - Moved `test_final_modified.py`, `final_e2e_test_fixed.py`, and `test_phase5.py` to the `tests/` directory
   - All test files are now consolidated in the appropriate testing directory

2. **Sample Data Generation**
   - Removed redundant `create_sample_pdf.py` from the root directory, as a more comprehensive version exists in the `scripts/` directory
   - Backup of the original root version saved as `scripts/create_sample_pdf_root_backup.py`

3. **Documentation Improved**
   - Moved `phase7_final_production_readiness_report.md` and `phase7_final_testing_report.md` to the `docs/` directory
   - Moved `graph_with_lines.txt` (which was a copy of `backend/app/retriever/graph.py`) to `docs/archive/`

4. **Data Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `data/` directory for database files
   - Moved `graph.db` to the `data/` directory
   - Updated configuration in `backend/app/core/config.py` to reflect the new path

5. **Benchmarking Files**
   - Created a dedicated `benchmarks/` directory
   - Moved `benchmark_results.json` to the `benchmarks/` directory

## Impact

These organizational changes have:
- Reduced clutter in the root directory
- Grouped related files together in appropriate directories
- Improved project maintainability
- Made the project structure more intuitive for new developers
- Followed software development best practices for project organization

## Note About SQLite-vss to SQLite-vec Transition

As noted in the project plan, the project has moved from SQLite-vss to SQLite-vec. This change has been reflected in the codebase, and all relevant files now use the new library.
