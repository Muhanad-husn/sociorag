# SocioGraph Phase 7 Implementation Plan

## Phase 7 Overview: Frontend Development

Phase 7 focuses on developing a modern React-based user interface that integrates with the comprehensive FastAPI backend created in Phase 6. This frontend will provide an intuitive interface for document management, real-time Q&A with streaming responses, and visualization of history data.

## Current Status Assessment

### âœ… Completed (Phase 6)
- Complete FastAPI backend with comprehensive API coverage
- Document management API endpoints (upload, processing, metadata)
- Q&A endpoints with streaming response capability
- History management endpoints with filtering and pagination
- Real-time progress tracking via SSE
- WebSocket support for bidirectional communication

### ðŸš§ Phase 7 Objectives
1. **React Application Setup** - Project structure and build configuration
2. **UI Component Library** - Design system and reusable components
3. **Document Management Interface** - Upload, processing, and management UI
4. **Real-time Q&A Interface** - Streaming answers with citations
5. **History Dashboard** - Search, filtering, and analytics visualization
6. **Responsive Design** - Mobile and desktop compatibility
7. **API Integration** - Comprehensive backend connectivity

## Development Approach

The frontend development will follow these principles:

1. **Component-First Development** - Build and test individual components before integration
2. **API-Driven Development** - Design components based on API contracts from Phase 6
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with core functionality and add advanced features incrementally
4. **Responsive-First Design** - Design for mobile first, then enhance for desktop
5. **Accessibility Focus** - Ensure all components are accessible and follow WCAG guidelines

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Testing** - Unit tests for individual components
2. **Integration Testing** - Tests for component interactions
3. **End-to-End Testing** - Full application workflows
4. **API Mock Testing** - Testing with mocked API responses
5. **Real Backend Testing** - Integration tests with the actual backend

## Delivery Timeline

- Week 1: Project setup, component library, and basic application structure
- Week 2: Document management interface and API integration
- Week 3: Q&A interface with real-time capabilities
- Week 4: History dashboard, responsive design, and final polish

## Success Criteria

- All Phase 7 objectives implemented and functional
- Comprehensive integration with Phase 6 backend
- Responsive design working on both mobile and desktop
- Clean, intuitive user interface for all core functionality
- Comprehensive documentation for frontend development
