# Phase 6 Housekeeping Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the housekeeping tasks completed after the successful implementation of Phase 6 (API Integration & FastAPI Backend) of the SocioGraph project.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Documentation

- ✅ Created Phase 6 Housekeeping Report (`PHASE6_HOUSEKEEPING_REPORT.md`)
- ✅ Created Phase 7 Implementation Plan (`docs/phase7_implementation_plan.md`)
- ✅ Updated main README.md with Phase 6 accomplishments and Phase 7 roadmap

### 2. Backup Management

- ✅ Created backup script (`scripts/backup_phase6.ps1`)
- ✅ Generated Phase 6 backup with all relevant files
- ✅ Documented backup contents and structure

### 3. Testing

- ✅ Created Phase 7 preparation script (`scripts/prepare_phase7.ps1`)
- ✅ Added sample PDF generation for API testing
- ✅ Verified API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Fixed sample PDF path in test script for reliable testing

### 4. Project Organization

- ✅ Reviewed and validated all API endpoints against implementation plan
- ✅ Ensured proper documentation of all implemented features
- ✅ Created cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup_phase6.ps1`) to organize files
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to exclude database files and backup directories
- ✅ Prepared project for Phase 7 development

## Updated Files

1. **New Files Created:**
   - `PHASE6_HOUSEKEEPING_REPORT.md`
   - `docs/phase7_implementation_plan.md`
   - `docs/phase6_housekeeping_summary.md`
   - `scripts/backup_phase6.ps1`
   - `scripts/prepare_phase7.ps1`

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `README.md` - Updated features and next steps
   
## Backup Details

A complete backup of Phase 6 was created with the following structure:

```plaintext
phase6_backup_[timestamp]/
├── docs/
│   ├── phase6_*.md
│   └── api_*.md
├── backend/
│   └── app/
│       ├── api/
│       └── main.py
├── scripts/
│   └── test_phase6_api.py
├── PHASE6_HOUSEKEEPING_REPORT.md
└── README.md
```

## Verification Results

API endpoint testing showed that all endpoints are functional, with the following observations:

1. Document upload requires a sample PDF (now addressed in prepare_phase7.ps1)
2. SSE endpoints for progress tracking are working correctly
3. WebSocket endpoints respond with proper ping/pong mechanisms
4. History management endpoints function as expected

## Next Steps

With Phase 6 housekeeping complete, the project is now ready for Phase 7: Frontend Development. The implementation plan provides a detailed roadmap for:

1. React application setup
2. UI component library
3. Document management interface
4. Real-time Q&A interface
5. History dashboard
6. Responsive design
7. API integration
