# SocioGraph Project Overview

## Project Summary

SocioGraph is a comprehensive system for analyzing and visualizing social dynamics in texts through advanced NLP, entity extraction, vector search, and answer generation capabilities. The system follows a modular architecture with distinct phases for data ingestion, storage, retrieval, and answer generation.

## Current Status: Production Ready

The project is now production-ready with all major development phases completed. The codebase has been streamlined by removing E2E tests and non-essential files to focus on the core functionality. The application is now more maintainable and easier to deploy.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline** (`backend/app/ingest/`)
   - Enhanced entity extraction with LLM-powered analysis
   - Robust JSON parsing with multiple fallback strategies
   - Batch processing with retry mechanisms
   - Document chunking and metadata extraction

2. **Vector Storage & Retrieval** (`backend/app/retriever/`)
   - SQLite-vec based vector storage (migrated from SQLite-vss)
   - Semantic search with reranking
   - Context retrieval with relevance scoring
   - Efficient similarity matching

3. **Answer Generation** (`backend/app/answer/`)
   - Streaming LLM responses via async generators
   - Citation management and source linking
   - PDF export with WeasyPrint/HTML fallback
   - Query history tracking with analytics

4. **Core Infrastructure** (`backend/app/core/`)
   - Singleton pattern for shared resources
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Logging and error handling
   - Database connections

5. **API Layer** (`backend/app/api/`)
   - FastAPI endpoints for Q&A functionality
   - Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming
   - File upload and static serving
   - RESTful interface design
