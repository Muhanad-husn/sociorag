The United Nations (UN) was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations.
The UN's mission is to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations,
achieve international cooperation, and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations.
The Security Council is one of the six principal organs of the UN, charged with ensuring international peace and security.
The United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom are permanent members of the Security Council.
The General Assembly is the main deliberative organ of the UN where all member states have equal representation.
