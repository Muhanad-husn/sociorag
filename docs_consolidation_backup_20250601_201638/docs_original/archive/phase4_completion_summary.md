## Phase 5 Readiness

With Phase 4 now complete and the codebase properly organized, the project is ready to proceed to Phase 5: API and UI Development. The backend components have been optimized and tested, providing a solid foundation for the development of user-facing features.

The following resources are available to guide Phase 5 development:
- `docs/phase5_preparation.md`: Detailed guidance for Phase 5 development
- Performance benchmarks for reference during API development
- Comprehensive backend component documentation

## Conclusion

The cleanup and organization of Phase 4 has been successfully completed. The codebase is now clean, well-documented, and ready for Phase 5 development. All essential components have been preserved and properly committed to the git repository, while unnecessary and temporary files have been removed or consolidated.
